# CBSD_Predictive_Models

The replicability crisis concerns the credibility of findings in various fields of study, including medicine, behavioral science, and data science. It denotes the idea that often, findings obtained by studies cannot be replicated, as researchers cannot obtain results comparable to the original when repeating the study using similar procedures. Because of this, the accuracy of these findings should be questioned and scrutinized.

In this project, we will use different feature selection methods to discover the most relevant predictors and evaluate their replicability, checking to see if the features selected as important by the different methods are consistent. We want to identify the most reliable predictors and analyze the unreliable model-dependent ones.

The feature selection and model training processes will be performed on thirteen different psychological tests with varying numbers of items.

The methods that will be used for feature selection are:

Recursive feature elimination
Mutual Information
Permutation importance
Chi-Square
Principal Component Analysis
The models, which will be run both in the original dataset and the one with the dimensions reduced, are:

Support Vector Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Then we will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and other metrics in order to evaluate the suitability of our models.
